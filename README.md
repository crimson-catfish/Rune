# Squall of spells
The main idea is game controlled by "runes" - a schematic symbols, drawn by player. Each of those has the corresponding spell to cast.
The spell system is ideologically similar to Magic: majority of the “runes” are immediately available to the player, but there is neither a list of possible rune draws nor a list of spells that runes cast. The player explores possible combinations in the process. And player improves their own skills rather than improves game character.

**Right now project is just one demoscene - rune creating. It includes creating and recognizing functionality.**

## Instalation:
1. Copy project via ```git clone```
2. Open _Window_ -> _Analysis_ -> _Input debugger_
3. Enable _Options_ -> _Simulate Touch Input From Mouse Or Pen_
 

> Create your own runes and see them recognized in RuneCreation scene
